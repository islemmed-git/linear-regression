#Linear Regression with Gradient Descent#

This Python script performs linear regression using gradient descent on a dataset. The purpose is to find the best-fitting line for the given data points.

**Requirements**

Python 3.x
Pandas
Matplotlib

**Installation**

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

**Usage**

Place your dataset in a CSV file named data.csv.
Run the script:
python linear_regression.py
The script will perform gradient descent and display the learned coefficients.

**Configuration**

You can adjust the learning rate (L) and the number of epochs (epochs) in the script.
L = 0.0001
epochs = 300

**Output**

The script will output the learned coefficients for the linear regression model and display a scatter plot of the data points along with the regression line.
